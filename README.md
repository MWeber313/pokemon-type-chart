**Purpose**: Googling Pokemon types to gather their strengths and weaknesses can sometimes be a chore, this simple Python program is meant to cut down the time it takes to find relevant data of a Pokemon's type.

## Requirements to run (Most platforms)
- Python3
- A Terminal or Terminal Emulator*
- Knowing which Pokemon type you want to search

-Support for generation 1 only
-Support for one attacking type and one defending type only


## Acknowledgements
